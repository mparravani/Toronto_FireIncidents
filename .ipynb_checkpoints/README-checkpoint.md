# Toronto_FireIncidents

Analysis of Toronto Fire Incidents data for the purposes of writing a blog post (Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project). The intention was to leverage this project for something that could provide some positive benefit to the city. This analysis looks to answer the following questions;  

1. Is there a large variability in response time by the different stations?  
2. Is the geo-spatial distribution of fire stations appropriate to all the locations? 
3. What's the most important feature to predict response time?
 
From the above, the data can be used to potentially assist in planning future stations (or funding of current ones), as well as a change in approach. 


## Getting Started 

The analysis was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.7.3, which can be installed through the Anaconda Distrubition.  

### Prerequisites 

The following packages are required;   
numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, missingno, geopandas, scipy, sklearn, shapely 
 
Install using the code below  
```
!pip install numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn pandas missingno geopandas, scipy, sklearn, shapely
```

## Data References 

The following data was used for this project;

## Instructions to Run Code

Code is set up in EDA to modeling workflow - and should be run sequentially. There are no secondary scripts referenced.
