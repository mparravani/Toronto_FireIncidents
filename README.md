# Toronto_FireIncidents

Analysis of Toronto Fire Incidents data for the purposes of writing a blog post (Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project). The intention was to leverage this project for something that could provide some positive benefit to the city. This analysis looks to answer the following questions;

1 - What is the distribution of fires through-out the city?
2 - What is the average response time for fires through-out the city?
3 - Is there correlation between neighborhood median income and fire occurances?
4 - What are the most important factors affecting the estimated dollar loss of fires?

From the above, the data can be used to potentially assist in planning future stations (or funding of current ones), as well as a change in approach.


## Getting Started

The analysis was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.7.3, which can be installed through the Anaconda Distrubition.

### Prerequisites

The following packages are required;
numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, missingno, geopandas

Install using the code below
```
!pip install numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn pandas missingno geopandas
```
